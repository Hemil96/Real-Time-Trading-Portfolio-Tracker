## Technical Skill Mastery

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture (Advanced Level)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master asynchronous communication patterns between microservices
- Implement event sourcing for complete audit trails and data recovery
- Design and implement CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Build resilient systems with saga patterns for distributed transactions

**Specific Skills Developed:**

**Event Sourcing Implementation:**
```typescript
// You'll build systems like this from scratch
interface PortfolioEvent {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: 'PositionAdded' | 'PositionSold' | 'DividendReceived';
  aggregateId: string;
  eventData: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  version: number;
}

class PortfolioAggregate {
  static fromHistory(events: PortfolioEvent[]): Portfolio {
    // Reconstruct current state from event history
  }
  
  applyEvent(event: PortfolioEvent): void {
    // Update aggregate state based on event
  }
}
```

**Practical Applications:**

# Architecture Decision Record: Event Sourcing Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to maintain a complete audit trail of all portfolio changes for regulatory compliance and debugging purposes. Traditional CRUD operations don't provide sufficient historical information.

## Decision
We will implement event sourcing for the Portfolio domain, storing all changes as immutable events in MongoDB.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Ability to replay events for debugging
- Support for temporal queries
- Natural fit for event-driven architecture

### Negative
- Increased complexity in read model maintenance
- Higher storage requirements
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with event sourcing
- Potential performance impact for complex aggregates

## Implementation Plan
1. Design event schemas for portfolio operations
2. Implement event store with MongoDB
3. Create read model projections in PostgreSQL
4. Implement snapshot mechanism for performance
```
